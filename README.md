proxy-lab
=========
This lab was an assignment for the course 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems) at CMU. I worked with one other partner to create a web proxy. In the first iteration, we implemented a basic sequential proxy that could only handle a single request at a time. The final iteration added more advanced functionalities such as caching and the ability to handle requests concurrently by use of threading.

In sight of the academic integrity policy at CMU, the repo containing this implementation is currently private, and I have created this placeholder instead. If you are a potential employer or have any other valid reason to see my code, please contact me personally and I will gladly provide it!
